  - Dang dude, I am impressed you made it this far. By the way, don't touch those
    spikes or you will die. I have grown rather attched to you and do not wish to
    see you dead. This carrot will give you the ability to double jump, so thats
    pretty cool.
  - Go forward friend! There are obstacles to beat, carrots to find, and lots of
    green grass!
  - If I am saying these words, something is terribly wrong
